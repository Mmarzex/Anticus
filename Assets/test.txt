You are on an island. You donâ€™t know how you got there. You hear a voice inside your head screaming, you must get back. You cannot remember why. There is a book on the sand next to you. You pick it up, you cannot read it, the glyphs must be ancient. You begin walking towards the center of the island, hoping beyond hope that there is some sort civilization that maybe just maybe help you find out who you are.
